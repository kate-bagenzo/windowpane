# windowpane demo | page 3 | text pages

if you want to override the link - make it an image or simply have different text - you can create an anchor element with an href value of `next-page`

<a href="next-page">this link takes you to the next page</a>

<a href="next-page">so does this one</a>

<a href="next-page"><img src="./images/window.png"></a>

even that image is wrapped in a link!
